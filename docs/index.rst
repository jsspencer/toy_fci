Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) method for the uniform electron gas.

This is a particularly simple implementation in python: little attempt is made
to conserve memory or CPU time.  Nevertheless, it is useful for small test
calculations, in particular for investigating ideas about the sign problem in
the Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method
discussed by Spencer, Blunt and Foulkes (J. Chem. Phys. 136, 054110 (2012);
arXiv:1110.5479).

Requires python 2.6 or later and numpy.  All code is compatible with python 3.
